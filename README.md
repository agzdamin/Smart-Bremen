# Smart Bremen - The Forgotten City 🌍🏙️

## 📌 Project Overview
**Smart Bremen** is a web platform developed to map and document informal practices in the city of Bremen, Germany. Informality refers to urban activities, spaces, and practices existing outside formal regulatory frameworks, such as graffiti, pop-up markets, and unregulated community initiatives.  

This project was carried out at the University of Bremen by a team of 15 students, divided into **Artistic** and **Technical** teams. The Technical team was further split into **Backend** (4 members) and **Frontend** (2 members), with 2 project managers overseeing the development.

The main goal was to create a platform where users can register, contribute, and explore informal activities across the city, which are later verified by admins and displayed on an interactive city map.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Provide a **user-friendly web platform** for documenting informal activities in Bremen.
- Enable **community participation** by allowing registered users to contribute content.
- Implement **role-based access control** (Admin, Artist, Viewer) for secure content management.
- Visualize informal practices on a **city map** using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap.
- Create a **scalable, API-driven backend** to support future enhancements.
